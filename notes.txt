A dictionary of children, where the keys are characters and the values are other TrieNodes. This allows the trie to store words of any length, since each word can be represented as a path from the root node to a leaf node.
A boolean value that indicates whether or not the TrieNode represents the end of a word.
The Trie class is a collection of TrieNodes. It has one important field:

A root TrieNode, which is the starting point for all searches.
The Trie class has three methods:

insert(word: str): This method adds the given word to the trie.
search(word: str): This method returns True if the given word is in the trie, and False otherwise.
starts_with(prefix: str): This method returns True if the given prefix is a prefix of any word in the trie, and False otherwise.
The BoggleSolver class is a class that can be used to solve boggle puzzles. It has the following fields:

trie: A Trie object that stores all of the words that can be formed on the boggle board.
board: A 2D list of strings that represents the boggle board.
rows: The number of rows in the boggle board.
cols: The number of columns in the boggle board.
visited: A 2D list of booleans that indicates which cells on the boggle board have been visited.
found_words: A set of strings that stores all of the words that have been found on the boggle board.
The BoggleSolver class has two methods:

init(trie: Trie, board: list[list[str]]): This method initializes the BoggleSolver object.
solve(): This method finds all of the words that can be formed on the boggle board and stores them in the found_words field.
The solve() method works by recursively searching the boggle board for words. The search starts at the top left corner of the board and works its way down and to the right. At each step, the search checks to see if the current cell contains a letter that is a prefix of any word in the trie. If it does, the search recursively searches the neighboring cells for the rest of the word. If the search finds a complete word, it adds the word to the found_words field.
